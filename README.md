🏠 Final Report – Hostel Management System
📌 Title:
Hostel Management System

📖 Introduction:
The Hostel Management System simplifies and automates essential administrative operations in university hostels. It replaces time-consuming and error-prone manual processes by digitally managing student records, room allocations, visitor logs, complaints, and payment tracking. The system offers secure, role-based access for Admins, Wardens, Sub-Wardens, and Students through dedicated user interfaces.

❗ Problem Statement:
Traditional hostel operations are managed through paper-based systems, which often result in:

Delayed processing of requests and updates

Difficulty in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records

Limited accessibility and transparency for stakeholders

🎯 Aim:
To design and implement a user-friendly, secure, and fully functional web-based system that streamlines all hostel-related administrative tasks and improves efficiency, accuracy, and communication.

✅ Proposed Solution:
This PHP & MySQL-based Hostel Management System includes:

A central Admin Dashboard to manage students, rooms, complaints, and payments

Warden/Sub-Warden Portals for complaint handling, room assignments, and visitor records

Student Portal to view personal details, payment history, and submit complaints

Secure session handling and authentication with role-based access

Clean, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap

⚠️ Key Challenges Faced:
Designing a well-structured and normalized relational database

Handling foreign key constraints and entity relationships

Implementing secure and role-restricted access across modules

Maintaining consistent UI/UX across all user roles and pages
